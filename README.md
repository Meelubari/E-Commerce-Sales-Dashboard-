 ###

<h1 align="left">Actionable Recommendations</h1>

###
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Diversify Customer Base:</strong>
      Reduce reliance on top customers by launching <em>customer acquisition campaigns</em> such as discounts,
      referral bonuses, and targeted ads to attract new buyers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Boost Retention & Loyalty:</strong>
      Flat customer growth suggests the need for <em>loyalty programs</em> and <em>personalized offers</em>
      to increase repeat purchases. Use insights from top spenders to design mid-tier packages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leverage Seasonal Trends:</strong>
      Sales peak in June but dip in February and April. Introduce <em>bundles, discounts, and targeted promotions</em>
      in weaker months to smooth out demand fluctuations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Product Strategy:</strong>
      Scale production and inventory for high-demand units (<b>Ct, Cans, Bottles</b>).
      Promote underperforming products via <em>cross-selling and bundles</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regional Expansion:</strong>
      Invest more in <b>Bangladesh and India</b> where sales are strongest.
      Explore <em>localized offers</em> and partnerships in Eastern Europe to capture growth opportunities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Revenue Optimization:</strong>
      Since growth is volume-driven, test <em>small price adjustments</em> in high-demand regions or products.
      Consider introducing <em>premium product tiers</em> for top customers who are less price-sensitive.
    </li>
  </ul>
